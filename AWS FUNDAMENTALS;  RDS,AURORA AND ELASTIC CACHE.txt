AMAZON RDS OVERVIEW
RDS = relational data base service.
it is a managed database for DB that use SQL as a query language.
it allows you to create DB in the cloud and are managed by AWS
Amazon RDS supports the following DB:
Postgres
MySQL
MariaDB
Oracle
Microsoft SQL Server
Aurora (AWS proprietary DB)

ADVANTAGE OF USING RDS TO DEPLOY EC2 INSTANCE.

RDS is a managed service:
	automated provisioning, OS patching
	continous backup and restore to a specific time stamp (Point in Time Restore)
	monitory dashboards
	read replica
	multi AZ for Disaster recovery
	scaling capability
	strorage backed by EBS (gp2 or io1)
BUT you cant SSH into your instance.

RDS - STORAGE AUTO SCALING.
RDS helps you to scale your storage automatically
avoid manual scaling your database storage.
You have to set a maximum threshold limit.
helps modify your storage
useful for applications with unpredicted workloads.
supports all RDS DB engine.




=====================================================

RDS READ REPLICA VS MULTI AZ

RDS READ REPLCAS for read scalability
up to 15 read replicas
with AZ, accross AZ or accross region
replica is async. so read are always consistent.
replica can be promoted to their own DB.
application must update the connection string to leverage read replicas

RDS RR USECASE
Used for reporting applications. the reporting application connects to the read replica so your main DB connceted to the production application is unaffected
they are used for SELECT(==read)only  kind of statement.


RDS RR NETWORK COST.
in AWS, there is a nework cost when data goes from one AZ to another.
for RDS RR within the same region you dont have to pay.

PLS NOTE: You can not create encrypted Read Replicas from an unencrypted RDS DB instance.


RDS MULTI AZ (FOR DISASTER RECOVERY)
sync replication
one DNS name, automatic app failover to standby.
increase availability
failover, incase of loss AZ, network, instance or storage failure.
no manual interventions in app.
not used for scaling.

multi-AZ when used does not require you to change the SQL connection string.

NOTE: the read replica can be set up as multi AZ for disaster recovery.


RDS FROM SINGLE-AZ TO MULTI-AZ
it is a zero downtime operation (which means you dont need to stop the DB)
just click on modify for the DB and selec multi AZ

the following will happen internally:
snapshot will be taken
a new DB is restored from the snapshot to another AZ
Synchronisation is enabled between the two databases


=======================================================================

RDS CUSTOM FOR ORACLE AND MYSQL SERVER
RDS custom is for oracle and MySQL server only.
RDS custom gives you access to the underlying db and OS so you can:
	configure settings
	install patches
	enable natives features 
	access the underlying EC2 instance using SSH or SSM session manager.

NOTE: deactivate automation mode to perform your customisation. it is important to take a snapshot since you are accessing the underlying instance

RDS VS RDS CUSTOM
RDS: fully mamaneged  by AWS.
RDS CUSTOM: full admin access to the underlying instance and OS.


=========================================================================

AMAZON AURORA
aurora is a proprietory technology from AWS (it is not open source)
postgres and mysql are both supported as aurora db (that means your driver will work as if aurora was a postgres or myql database)
aurora is AWS cloud-optimized and claims 5x improved performance over mysql, 3x performance over postgres on RDS. 
aurora storage automatically grows in increment from 10GB to 128TB
can have 15 replicas and replication proces is faster than mysql
failover in aurora is instantaneous. its HA native

AURORA HIGH AVAILABILITY AND READ SCALING.
6 copies of your data accross 3AZ
	4 copies out of 6 needed for write
	3 copies out of 6 needed for read
	self healing with peer-to-peer replication
	storage is stripped across 100 volumes
aurora instance takes write (master)
1 master + up to 15 read replicas servers read
the read replica supports cross region replication.


AURORA DB CLUSTER
Writer endpoint is only enabled on the master
the reader endpoint is conncetd to a load balancer, the replicas are then connected with load balancer connection attached to an ASG.

FEATURES OF AURORA
automatic failover, backup and recovery, isolation and security, industry compliance, push-button scaling, 
automated patching with zero-downtime, advance monitoring, routine maintainace, backtrack (restore data at any point of time without using backups)

==================================================

AMAZON AURORA - ADVANCED CONCEPTS

AURORA CUSTOM allows you to use the custom endpoint in place of the reader endpoint

AURORA SERVERLESS allows automated db instantiation, no capacity planning, good for infrequent unpredicted workload, cost-effective (pay per sec)

AURORA MULTI-MASTER used in case you want multi write avilability for the writer node. 
	every node does R/W, promoting read replica as the new master
GLOBAL AURORA used for disaster recovery, simple to put in place, (THIS IS RECOMMENDED)
	1 primary region (read/write), 5 secondary region(read only), 16 read replicas per region and helps to decrease latency
AURORA MACHINE LEARNING enables you to add ML-based prediction to your applications via SQL
	simple, optimised and secure integration betwen AURORA and AWS ML services 
	supported services : AMAZON SageMaker(for any ML model), amazon comprehend (for sentiment analysis) 

=====================================================

RDS AND AURORA: BACKUP AND MONITORING

RDS BACKUP
automated backup: do a daily backup during backup window. the earliest backup is 5mins, retention of 1-35days

MANUAL DB SNAPSHOT
manually triggered by users
retention of backup as long as you want it.


AURORA DB CLONING
it allows you to create a new aurora cluster from an existing one.
faster than snapshot and restore.
use copy-on-write protocol
very fast and cost effective
useful to create a staging DB from a production DB without impacting the production DB

===============================================================================

RDS AND SECURITY
AT REST encryption using KMS at launch
if master is not encrypted, the read replica cannot be encrypted.

IN-TRANSIT encryption use AWS TLS root certificate client-side
IAM auhtntication
security groups. to control network access
no SSH except RDS custom
audit log can be enabled and send to cloudwatch log for longer retention

============================================================

AMAZON RDS PROXY
fully managed DB proxy for RDS
allows app to share and pull DB connections established with the DB
Improve DB efficiency by reducing the stress on DB resources
serverless, autoscaling and highly available (multi-AZ)
reduced RDS and aurora failover time by up 66%
supports RDS and AURORA DB
No code changes for most apps
enforce IAM authentication for DB and securely store credentials in the AWS secret manager.
it is never publicly accessible. you can only connect via VPC

====================================================================

ELASTIC CACHE OVERVIEW
the same way RDS is to get managed RDS, 
ElastiCache is to get managed Redis or MemCache
Caches are in-memory DB  with high performance and low latency.
Helps reduce load on DB for read intensive workloads
helps to make your application stateless.
AWS takes up OS maintainance
using ElastciCache requires heavy application code changes

ARCHITECTURE FOR USING ELASTIC CACHE
Application queries ElasticCache. if not available, gets from RDS and writes into the Cache.
this architecture helps reduce load in RDS
Cache must have invalidation strategy to make sure only the most recent data is used in there.

USER SESSION STORE
when a user hits the application, the user writes into the ElasticCache
if the user hits another instance of our app, the user receives data that it has already writes in. the cache is like an inbound memory and makes your app stateless.


REDIS VS MEMCACHED
REDIS
high availability
data durability using AOF persistency.
Multi-AZ

MEMCACHED
No high availability
multinode for partitioning of data (sharding)
non persistent
no backup and restore
multi-threaded architecture.


===============================================================================

ELASTICACHE FOR SOLUTION ARCHITECT

Cache Security:
supports IAM authentication for REDIS
IAM policies on ElastiCache are only used for AWS API-Level security
REDIS auth.
Memcahed supports SASL-based authentication (advanced)

PATTERNS FOR ELASTICACHE

1. LAZY LOADING: all the read data is cached. data can become stale from caching.
2. WRITE-THROUGH: Adds or update data written to a cache when written to a DB (no stale data)
3. SESSION STORE: Store temporarily session data in a cache.(using TTL features)

REDIS USECASE
gaming leaderboards are computationally complex.
sorted set guarantee both element ordering and uniqueness.
each time a new element is added, it is ranked in real-time, then added in real order.


List of Ports to be familiar with
Here's a list of standard ports you should see at least once. You shouldn't remember them (the exam will not test you on that),
but you should be able to differentiate between an Important (HTTPS - port 443) and a database port (PostgreSQL - port 5432) 

Important ports:
FTP: 21
SSH: 22
SFTP: 22 (same as SSH)
HTTP: 80
HTTPS: 443

RDS Databases ports:
PostgreSQL: 5432
MySQL: 3306
Oracle RDS: 1521
MSSQL Server: 1433
MariaDB: 3306 (same as MySQL)
Aurora: 5432 (if PostgreSQL compatible) or 3306 (if MySQL compatible)

Don't stress out on remember those, just read that list once today and once before going into the exam and you should be all set :)
Remember, you should just be able to differentiate an "Important Port" vs an "RDS database Port".

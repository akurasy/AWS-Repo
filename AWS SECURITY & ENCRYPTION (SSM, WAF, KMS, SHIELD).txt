ENCRYPTION 101

ENCRYPTION IN FLIGHT (SSL) 
Data is encrypted before sending and decrypted after receiving.
SSL certificate helps with encryption (HTTPS). This protects you against the man in the middle attack.
Encryption in flight ensures no MITM (Man In The Middle)attack can happen.


SERVER SIDE ENCRYPTION (SSE) AT REST
Data is encrypted after being received by the server
Data is decrypted before being sent.
stored in an encrypted form (data key)
encryption/decryption key must be managed somewhere and server must have access to it (KMS)

CLIENT SIDE ENCRYPTION
Data is encrypted by the client and never decrypted by the server
Data will be decrypted by the receiving client
server should not be able to decrypt the data
could leverage envelope encryption


=========================================================

AWS KMS (KEY MANAGEMENT SERVICE)

NOTE: ANY TIME YOU HEAR AN ENCRYPTION FOR AWS SERVICES, IT IS MOST LIKELY KMS

AWS manages encrption key for us
fully integrated with IAM for authorization
easy way to control access to your data
able to audit KMS key usage using cloudtrail
seamlessly integrated with most AWS services (EBS, S3, RDS, SSM)
never write your secret in plane text, especially in your code

TYPES OF KMS KEY

KMS keys is the new name for KMS customer master key

symmetric  (AES-256 KEYS)
	Single encryption keys that is used to encrypt and decrypt
	AWS services that are managed with KMS uses the symetric CMKs
	you never get access to to the KMS keys unencrypted (must call KMS API to use)

asymmetric (RSA & ECC key pairs)
	public (encrypt) and private key (decrypt) pair.
	used for encrypt/decrypt , or sign/verify operations
	public key is downloadable, but you cannot use the private key unencrypted
USECASE; encryption outside AWS for users who cant make API calls 

AWS OWNED KEYS - SSE-S3, SSE-SQS, SSE-DDB (default key)

COPYING SNAPSHOTS ACCROSS ACCOUNT
-create a snapshot encryoted with your own key (CMK)
-attach KMS policy to allow cross account access
-share the encrypted snapshot
-in target, create a copy of the snapshot , encrpt with a CMK in your account.
-create a volume for the snapshot

==================================================

KMS MULTI REGION

USECASE --- Global client side encryption,  encryption on global dynamo db, global aurora


=========================================================

S3 REPLICATION WITH ENCRYPTION 

unencrypted and objects encrypted with SSE-S3 are replicated by default.
objects encrypted with SSE-C (customer provided key) are never replicated
objects encrypted with SSE-KMS you need to enable the option.

============================================

ENCRYPTED AMI SHARING PROCESS

AMI is secured with KMS encrypted key from the source account 
modify the image attribute of the key to add a launch permission which corresponds to the specified target AWS account.
must share the KMS key used to create the snapshot that the AMI reference with the target account.
IAM/USER in the target account must have the permissions to DescribeKey, ReEncrypted, CreateGrant, Decrypt.
when launching an EC2 with the AMI, the target account can specify a new KMS key in its own account to reencrypt the volumes


==========================================================

SSM PARAMETER STORE OVERVIEW

- It is a secure storage for configurations and secrets
- optional seamless envryption using KMS
- serverless, scalable, durable and easy SDK
- version tracking of configurations / secrets
- security through IAM
- notifications with amazon event bridge
- integration with cloud formation

types = standard (4kb) and advanced tier (8kb)

parameter policies (advanced)= allows you to assign a TTL on parameters.
				attach multiple policies at a time
				
===========================================================

AWS SECRETS MANAGER OVERVIEW

Meant for storing secrets
capability to force the rotation of secret every xdays
automate generation of secrets on rotation (uses Lambda)
integration with amazon RDS

AWS SECRETS MANAGER MULTI REGION SECRETS
replicate escrets accross multiple regions 
secret manager keeps secrets in sync with the primary secret
ability to promote  read replica secret into a standalone secret.
USECASE: multi region app, disaster recovery, multi-region DB

===================================================


AWS WEB APPLICATION FIREWALL (WAF)
WAF is used to protect your web app from common web exploits (layer 7)
layer 7 is HTTP (vs layer 4 TCP/UDP)

deploy on: (endpoints)
application load balancer
API gateway
cloudfront
cognito user pool
Appsync GraphQL API

web ACL are used to control access to your server. they are regional except for cloudfront.

WAF does not support the network load balancer (layer4)

=======================================================


AWS SHIELD: DDOS PROTECTION
protects from DDOS attack.
DDOS = distributed denial of service = too many requests at the same time
the goal of DDOS is to overload your infrastructure

aws shield standard = provides support against SYN/UDP and other layrer3 or layer 4 attacks

aws shield advance = provides support against ELB, cloudfront distribution, route53,  EC2, GA, 
access to DDOS response team
protect against higher fee resulting using usage of the atack
it automatically creates, evaluates and deploy WAF rules to mitigate layer7 attacks

===============================================


AWS FIREWALL MANAGER (FM)
manage rules in all accounts in AWS organization.

========================================= 

WAF VS SHIELD VS FM
They are used together for comprehensive protection
define your web ACL rule in WAF
for granular protection of your resources, WAF alone is not a best choice
if you want to use WAF accross multiple accounts, use AWS Firewall Manager
shield advance have additional features such as shield reponse team, and advanced reporting 
if you are prone to frequent DDOS everytime, consider shield advanced. 

=======================================================

AMAZON GUARDDUTY

Intelligent threat discovery to protect your account.
uses ML algorithm, anomaly detection, third party data.
can setup eventbridge rules to ne notified in case of any findings
evenbridge rules can target AWS lmabda or SNS
can protect against cryptocurrency attack.


===================================

AMAZON INSPECTOR
Allows you to run automated security assessment

For EC2:
	leveraging the AWS system manager (SSM) agent
	anaylse against unintended network accessibility
	analyse the running OS against kniwn vulnerability

For container images push to amazon ECR
	assessment of container images as they are pushed

For lamba function
	identifies software vulnerability
	assessment of functions as they deploy.


can report findings to AWS security hub
send findings to amazon eventbridge
continous scaling of infrastructure.

======================================================


AWS MACIE
AWS MACIE is a fully managed data security and data privacy service  that uses ML to detect and protect your sensitive data in AWS.
it identifies and alerts you to sensitive data such as personal identifiable information (PII)
alert can be sent to amazon eventbridge

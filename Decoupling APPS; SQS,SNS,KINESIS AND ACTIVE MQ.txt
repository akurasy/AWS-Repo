INTRODUCTION TO MESSAGING.

buying service ========= shipping service = synchronous communication
buying service =====Queue=======shipping service = asynchronous communication

synchronous can be problematic if there is a sudden spike in traffic.
in this case it is better to decouple your applications using,
SQS-  Queue model
SNS - Pub/Sub model
Kinesis- real time streaming model.

================================================

SQS
what is a Queue?: queue service helps to decouple messages between a producer and a consumer.
fully managed service for decoupling applications. anytime you see decoupling in your exam, think about SQS.
Unlimited number of messaages in Queue
default retention of 4days and max of 14days
limitation 256kb per message sent
to decouple between two application tier.

SECURITY; encryption. IAM policy, SQS policy (similar to S3 policy)

Amazon SQS allows you to retain messages for days and process them later, while we can take down our EC2 instances.


========================================================

SQS FIFO QUEUE
first in first out (FIFO) 
ordering messages in the queue
300 messages per sec and max of 3000 messages per sec with batch operation. 
exactly one send capability

=========================================

AMAZON SNS

Simple notification service: used to send messages to many receivers
up to 12million subscribers per topic
100,000 topic limit.

SNS ========> PUBLISH TO SUBSCRIBERS (email, HTTP/HTTPS endpoint, SMS and mobile notifications)

many AWS service can be message to SNS for notifications. Example;
AWS budget, cloudwatch alarm, ASG, S3 Bucket, Cloudformation, AWS DMS

HOW TO PUBLISH TO SNS
-	create a topic
-	create a subscription (or many)
-	publish to the topic. 


SNS SECURITY
Inflight encryption, encryption at rest (KMS), client-side encryption.



SNS-FANOUT
Used in sending multiple message to multiple SQS, S3 queue,  SNS TO S3 through data kinetic firehouse, FIFO capability.


==========================================================


AMAZON KINESIS
makes you to collect, process and analyse data stream in real-time
ingest real-time data such as : application logs, metrics, website clickstreams, IoT telemetrics data.

Kinesis Data Stream: collect, process and stores data streams.
stores data for 1 to 365days
data is immutable (cannot be deleted)
data that shares same partition goes to the same shard.

Kinesis Data Firehose: load data stream into AWS data store

Kinesis Data Analytics: analyse data stream with SQL and apache flink

Kinesis Video Streams: capture, process and store video streams

=========================================================



KINETIC DATA FIREHOSE
takes data from sources and write them into destinations
sources = kinesis data stream, amazon cloudwatch, AWS IoT
destination= S3 endpoint, amazon redshift, amazon opensearch and other 3rd parry destinations (mongo db, data dog, newrelic)

EXAM QUESTION; DIFF BTW KINESIS DATA STREAM AND KINESIS FIREHOSE

DATA STREAM: 
	streaming service for ingest at scale
	write custom code (producer / consumer)
	real time
	managing scale
	stores data up to 1 to 365days
	supports replay capability

FIREHOSE:
	load stteaming data into s3, aws redshift, and amazon open search
	near real-time (about 60 secs)
	automatic scaling
	no data storage
	doesnt support replay capabilities.

===================================================================

ORDERING DATA IN KINESIS AND SQS

KINESIS DATA
to send data in kinesis, you can use the pertition key.
the same key will always go to the same shard.

The capacity limits of a Kinesis data stream are defined by the number of shards within the data stream. 
The limits can be exceeded by either data throughput or the number of reading data calls. 
Each shard allows for 1 MB/s incoming data and 2 MB/s outgoing data. 
You should increase the number of shards within your data stream to provide enough capacity.

SQS
no ordering in SQS standadrd
in SQS FIFO , if you dont use the group ID, messages are consumed in the order they are sent.

KINESIS VS SQS ORDERING

KINESIS
you will have data ordered in each shard
max number of consumer in parallel is 5
can receive up to 5mb of data

SQS FIFO
you can only have one SQS FIFO queue
you will have 100 group ID
you can have up to 100 customers 
up to 300 messages per second (or 3000 if use batching)


=========================================================


SQS VS SNS VS KINESIS

SQS:
consumer pull data
data is deleted after being consumed
we can have many consumers
to need to provision throughput
ordeing guaranteed only on FIFO
individual message delay capabilities

SNS
push data to many consumers
up to 12,5m subscribers
no data persistence
up to 100,000 topics
no throughput provision.

KINESIS
standard more : customers pull data from kinesis. 2mb per shard
ehnanced fan-out : push data to customers
real time data analytics
possible to replay data
ordering at the shard level
provisioned mode or on-demand capacity




==========================================

AMAZON MQ
When migrating to cloud, instead of rearranging the application to use SNS and SQS, you can use MQ
amazon MQ is a managed message broker 

Amazon MQ supports industry-standard APIs such as JMS and NMS, and protocols for messaging, including AMQP, STOMP, MQTT, and WebSocket.

Amazon MQ helps you migrate your applications to AWS without re-engineering the applications and modifying the code

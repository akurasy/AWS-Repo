S3 ENCRYPTION.
You can encrypt object in S3 using one of the following methods

1. SERVER-SIDE ENCRYPTION. (SSE)
	different flavours of SSE: AMAZON S3 - MANAGED  Keys (SSE-S3 enabled by default)
	SSE with KMS key stored in AWS KMS (SSE-KMS), MANAGED BY USERS BUT HAS KMS LIMITATIONS
	SSE with customer provided key (SSE-C). managed outside of AWS and discarded when used.

2. CLIENT-SIDE ENCRYPTION 
	use client library
	the client must encrypt data themselves before uploading to S3.
	client must decrypt data themselves when retieving from S3. decryption and encryption is done outside amazon S3

	customer fully manage keys and encryption cycle

3. ENCRYPTION IN TRANSIT (SSL/TSL)
	Encryption in flight is also called SSL or TLS
	amazon as two endpoints. (1) HTTP; not encrypted (2) HTTPS; encrypted in flight.

=================================================

DEFAULT ENCRYPTION VS BUCKET POLICIES
By default AWS automatically uses SSE-S3 when object is being created.
you can force encryption using bucket policies. you can deny any API call to put an object with encryption header (from SSE-KMS OR SSE-C)
you can use bucket policy to deny the automatic encryption and set your own encryption pattern.

NOTE: BUCKET POLICIES ARE EVALUATED BEFORE DEFAULT ENCRYPTION

=====================================================

S3 CORS
Cross-Origin Resource Sharing
CORS is a web browser based mechanism that allow requests to other origins while visiting the main origin.

IF A CLIENT MAKES A CROSS-REGION REQUEST ON OUR S3 BUCKET, THEN WE NEED TO ENABLE THE CORRECT CORS HEADER

THIS IS A VERY POPULAR EXAM QUESTION. 

================================================

AWS MFA DELETE
MFA forces user to generate a code from a third party application which provides access to S3 console. 

MFA will be required to permanently delete object, delete versioning.  these processes are both destructive.

MFA wont be required to enable versioning, list deleted versions

to use MFA, versioning must be enabled. only the bucket owner (root account) can enable/disable MFA.

======================================================

S3 ACCESS LOG

for audit purposes, you may want to log all the access to S3 bucket
for any request made to S3
it is region specific.
do not use your monitored bucket as logging bucket.

==============================================

S3 PRE SIGNED URL

this is to generate a temporary url to give access to certain object in a bucket
the pre-signed url inherits the permissions of the user that generated the url. but a time limit (url expiration) can be applied

===============================

S3 GLACIER VAULT LOCK.
The idea is to adopt a WORM (write once read many) model.
create a vault lock policy
lock the policy for future edit.
helpful for compliance and data retention

S3 OBJECT LOCK (VERSIONING MUST BE ENABLED)
adopt a worm model
block object version deletion for a specific period of time.


===================================

S3 ACCESS POINT.

Access point defines various ways to have access to our S3 bucket. 
we can create certain permission level for certain users by defining an access point for them.
Each access point has its own dns name
they can be privately accessible via VPC USING vpc endpoint



============================================

S3 OBJECT LAMBDA
it invokes a lambda function to retain a redacted object from an application.

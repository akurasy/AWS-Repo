ECS, FARGATE, ECR AND EKS.

DOCKER INTRODUCTION
Docker is a software development platform to deploy apps.
Apps are packaged in containers that can be run on any OS

USECASE:	microservice architecture, lift and shift app from onpremise to cloud.

DOCKER images are stored in docker repositories.

docker container management on AWS
amazon ECS: Amazon's owned container platform
amazon EKS: amazon's managed kubernetes service (open source)
amazon fargate: amazon own serverless container platform.
	works with EKS and ECS
amazon ECR: Stores container images


==================================================

AMAZON ECS
AMAZON elastic container service. 

ECS - EC2 LAUNCH TYPE 
docker containers are placed on amazon 	EC2 launch instance
EC2 runs the ECS agent to register in the ECS cluster.
AWS takes care of starting and stopping the containers
it is used to deploy the docker images stored on ECR


ECS - FARGATE LAUNCH TYPE
LAUNCH docker container on AWS
no EC2 instance provisioned
it is serverless


IAM ROLE FOR ECS
EC2 instance profile (EC2 launch type only)


ECS - DATA VOLUMES (EFS)

ECS uses the EFS as mount volume=========== PLS NOTE 

EFS volume can be shared between different EC2 instances and different ECS Tasks. 
It can be used as a persistent multi-AZ shared storage for your containers.

mount EFS file system unto ECS task.
works for both EC2 and fargate
task running in any AZ will contain the same data in the EFS file system
fargate + EFS = Serverless. 

NOTE: Amazon S3 cannot be mounted as a file system on your ECS task.


==================================================================


AMAZON ECS - SOLUTIONS ARCHITECTURES

ECS task is invoked by an even bridge

All new applications to be deployed must have a fresh IAM role policy.

===============================================

AMAZON ECR
ELASTIC CONTAINER REGISTRY= use to store and manage docker images on AWS.
fully integrated with ECS, backed by amazon S3
Access is controlled through IAM
it supports versioning, image vulnerability, scanning, image tags and image lifecycle

=====================================================


AMAZON EKS
amazon elastic kubernetes service is an open source system used to deploy and manage containerized (usually docker)applications such as docker images.
it is a way to launch managed kubernetes cluster on AWS.
it is an alternative to ECS. but similar API
EKS supports EC2 if you want to deploy worker nodes or fargate (serverless)
USECASE: if a company is already using kubernetes on-premise and they want to migrate to AWS cloud using kubernetes
EKS is cloud agnostic. i.e can work in any kind of cloud providers (Azure, Google Cloud .....)
EKS supports fargate.
you can attcah data volume to amazon EKS (only supports EBS and EFS (EFS works with Fargate), amazon FSx for lustre, amazon FSx for NetApp ONTAP)

======================================================

AWS APP RUNNER

It is a fully managed service that makes it easy to deploy web applications and and APIs at scale

no infrastructure experience required

starts with your source code or container image

automatic builds and deploy the web app

automatic scaling, load balancing, encryption and highly available

VPC access support

connects to a database, cache, and message queue services

USECASE: API, web services, microservices, rapid production deployment

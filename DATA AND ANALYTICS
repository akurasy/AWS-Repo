ATHENA

Athena is a serverless query service used to analyse data stored in amazon S3 bucket.
use standard SQL query language to analyse the file.
supports CSV, JSON, ORC, Avro, and Parquet
5$ per TB scanned
common used for amazon 	quicksight reporting/dasgboard

EXAM TIP: anytime you need to analyse your data on S3 using serverless query service, think ATHENA

ATHENA - FEDERATED QUERY
Uses data source connector that runs on AWS Lambda to run federated queries (e.g cloudwatch logs, dynamoDB, RDS)


===================================================

REDSHIFT

Based on PostrGRES technology , but not good for OLTP
Columnar storage of data. parallel query engine
10X better than other data warehouse
pay as you go 
use for intense data warehousing with many queries, use redshift instead of athena.

LOADING DATA INTO REDSHIFT
amazon kinesis
data firehose

amazon kinesis and data firehose is used to load data into redshift using the S3 copy command.

===================================================

AMAZON OPENSEARCH
survivor of amazon elasticsearch
with opensearch, you can search any fields
does not support SQL, but can be used via plugin
security: IAM, COGNITO, ENCRYPTION

You can use the kinesis data firehose or Lambda function to transfer data to opensearch.

=============================================

AMAZON EMR
Amazon Elastic Map Reduce
creates Hadoop cluster to create and analyse a vast amount of data 
usecase: data processing, machine learning

EMR NODE TYPES
MASTER NODE: manages node and manage health
CORE NODE: run task and store data
TASK NODE: just to run task

=================================================

AMAZON QUICKSIGHT

Serverless machine learning powered business intelligence service that creates interactive dashboards
usecase: business analytics, business visualisation, get business insight using data

DASHBOARD AND ANALYSIS
define users and groups. these users and groups only exist in quicksight and not IAM
You can share the analysis of your dashboard with users and groups
to share dashboard, you must first publish it
users who see the dashboard can also see the underlying data.

==================================================


AWS GLUE
managed extract, transform and load (ETL)service
used to prepare and trasform data for analysis
fully serverless service.

=============================

AWS LAKE FORMATION

data lake = central place to have all your data for analytics purposes
it automates many complex manual steps
combine both structured and unstructured data in the data lake

======================================================

KINESIS DATA ANALYTICS
FOR SQL APP
to provide real-time analysis for SQL statement and can also reference data from amzon S3
real time analytics on kinesis data stream and firehose
fully manager service and serverless
autoscaling and pay as you go.
real time dashboard and real time metrics

kinesis data stream vs kafka

KDS 
1mb limit
data streams with shard
TLS inflight encryption
KMS at rest encryption

KAFKA (MSK)
1mb default, configue for higher up to 10mb
uses partition
plaintext or TLS encryption in transit
KMS at rest encryption

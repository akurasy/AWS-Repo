AWS SNOW FAMILY OVERVIEW

snow family are offline families that allows you to perform data migration.

highly secured portable devices for collecting and processing the edge and migrate data in and out of AWS

DATA MIGRATION: snowcone, snowball edge and snow mobile
EDGING: snowcone and sonwball edge.

NOTE: IF TAKES MORE THAN ONE WEEK TO TRANSFER OVER A NETWORK, USE SNOWBALL.

SNOWBALL
snowball edge compute optimised = 42TB of SSD
snowball edge storage optimised = 80 TB of HDD

SNOWCONE
used instead of snowball in a space constraint environment. where snowball size doesnt fit.
14TB SSD and 8TB HDD

SNOWMOBILE
Can transfer exabytes of data up to 1,000,000TB
Better than snowball if you are sending 10PB of data.

AWS OPsHUB: A software you can install on your computer to manage your snow family device.


===========================================================

SNOWBALL INTO GLACIER
snowball cannot import data directly into glacier. the first thing is to import fisrt to S3
S3 the import to glacier using Lifecycle policy.

=====================================================

AMAZON FSx 
to launch a third party file system on AWS

types
lustre , windows file server, NetApp ONTAP, OpenZFS

FSx for windows
supports SMB protocol
can be mounted on linux instances
supports microsoft distributed file system (DFS) namespace
data is backed up daily to AWS

FSx for lustre
parallel distributed file system for large-scale computing
used for ML, HPC, video processing, financial modelling.


FSx for NetApp ONTAP
manage NetApp ONTAP on AWS
compactible with NFS, SMB and iSCSI protocol
works with different OS. linux, windows, MacOS, Vmware Cloud, amazon EC2 and EKS
point in time instantaneous cloning.


FSx for OpenZFS
only comtactible with NFS protocol.
to move workload running on ZFS to AWS.
works with different OS. linux, windows, MacOS, Vmware Cloud, amazon EC2 and EKS
snapshot compression and low cost.

=======================================================

STORAGE GATEWAY

The bridge between your AWS S3 and on-premise data is refferred to as STORAGE GATEWAY.

Works in HYBRID environment.

uses: disaster recovery, backup and restore, tier storage, onpremise cache for AWS data

TYPES:
S3 file gateway
FSx gateway
Tape gateway
Volume gateway

=======================================================

AWS TRANSFER FAMILY
fully-managed service for file transfer in and out of amazon S3 or amazon EFS using FTP protocol.

=======================================

AWS DATA SYNC
Move data in and out fro  on-premise or other cloud to AWS cloud. this is done using an agent. 

AWS to AWS= no agent needed

can synchronise to :
S3, EFS AND FSx

file permissions and metadata are preserved.

===========================================

STORAGE COMPARISON

S3 = object storage
S3 Glacier= object archival
EBS Volume= network storage for an EC2 instance
Instance storage= physical storage for your EC2 intsance
EFS= network file system for Linux instances, POSIX filesystem.
FSx for windows= network file system for windows server
FSx for luster = high computing performance for linux filesystem
FSx for NetApp ONTAP= High OS compactibility
FSx for OpenZFS= managed ZFS filesystem
Storage gateway= bridge between onpremise and clouD
Transfer family= FTP, FTPS, SFTP interface on amazon s3 or amazon EFS.
Datasync= schedule data sync from on-premise to AWS.
Snowcone/snowball/snowmobile= use in transfering large amount of data to the cloud physically
Database= for specific workloads, usually with indexing and querying

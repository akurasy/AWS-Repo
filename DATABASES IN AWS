CHOOSING THE RIGHT DATA BASE

We have a lot of managed databases in AWS. databases are chosen based on the following required architecture;
read heavy, write heavy, throughput, will it change, does it need scaling or fluctuate during the day
how much data to be stored and how long, will it grow, how are they accessed ?
data durabilty. source of truth for the data
latency requirements, data model
schema, reporting, flexibility, RDBMS, noSQ
LICENSE COST


DATABASE TYPES

- RDBMS - RDS and aurora- great for joint.
- noSQL - No joint, no SQL, : dynamodb, elasticache, neptune, documentdb(for mongodb), keyspaces (for apache cassandra)
- object store - S3
- data warehouse - redshift, athena, EMR
- search - opensearch (JSON)
- graphs - amazon neptune (displays relationship between data)
- ledger - quantum ledger database
- time series- amazon time-stream

============================================

AMAZON RDS

Managed POSTGRES / MYSQL / ORACLE / SQL SERVER / MARIA DB / CUSTOM (available for oracle and SQL)
autoscaling capability for storage
support for read replica and multi AZ
security through IAM, SG, KMS, SSL in transit.
automatic backup with point in time restor (up to 35 days)
manual db snapshot for long term recover
managed and scheduled maintainance
support for IAM authentication, integration with secret manager


=========================================

AMAZON AURORA

Compactible API for PostgreSQL and MySQL. used for seperation of storage and compute
data is stored in 6 replicas accross 3 AZ. and highly available, self-healing and autoscaling
has both read and write endpoint.
same security, maintainance and monitoring features as RDS
AURRORA IS SERVERLESS. for unpredictable, intemitent workload and no capapcity planning
Aurora multi-master = for continous writes failover (high write availability)
Aurora global = more than 16 db read instances in various region. less than 1sec storage replication.
Aurora Machine Learning.= perform ML using the sagemaker
Aurora database cloning. faster than snapshot.

Amazon Aurora is a MySQL and PostgreSQL-compatible relational database. It features a distributed, fault-tolerant, 
self-healing storage system that auto-scales up to 128TB per database instance. It delivers high performance
 and availability with up to 15 low-latency read replicas, point-in-time recovery, continuous backup to Amazon S3, and replication across 3 AZs.

===========================================

ELASTICACHE
Managed redis/memcache
in-memory data store . sub millisecond latency
supoort for clustering and multi-AZ read replica
security: IAM, redis authy, KMS, SG
backup/snapshot/point in time restore
frequent read and less write.
cannot use SQL for elasticache

IF THE EXAM IS ASKING FOR CODE MODIFICATION TO CACHE IN YOUR APPLICATION, THEN ELASTICACHE IS A GOD CHOICE, OTHERWISE NOT A GOOD CHOICE.

==========================================

DYNAMO DB

AWS proprietory technology. managed serverless database with millisecond latency.
autoscaling and provisioned on-demand capacity
can replace elasticache for a key/value store
highly available, multi AZ
DAX cluster for read cache
security is done through IAM
automated backup for PITR (35days)
export to S3 without using any read capacity unit (RCU), import from S3 without any WCU
Great to rapidly explore schema

=======================================

AMAZON S3

key/value for object
great for large objects
IAM security, bucket ploicy, ACL, object lock for glacier
serverless and max object size is 5TB

PLS VISIT S3 NOTE FOR FULL DETAILS


======================================

DOCUMENTDB (MONGODB)

no SQL database
used to store query and index (JSON DATA)
automatically scale workload with millions of request per second
storage grows automatically in increment of 10GB up to 64TB


========================================

AMAZON NEPTUNE

fully managed graph database
a popular graph dataset is social network
replication accross 3 AZ
great for knowledge graph (wikipedia), fraud detection and social network

=====================================

AMAZON KEYSPACES (FOR APACHE CASANDRA)
Open source noSQL distributed database.
serverless, scalable, highly Available and fully managed by AWS
thousands of request per second
on-demand and auto scaling
PITR

ANYWHERE YOU SEE APACHE CASANDRA, THINK ABOUT KEYSPACES.

=========================================

AMAZON QLDB
amazon quantum ledger database
a ledger is a book recording financial transactions 
used to review history made bto your application data over time
it is immutable. once written cannot be modified. this is crptographically modified.

ANY TIME YOU SEE FINANCIAL TRANSACTION AND LEDGER, THINK QLDB

=======================================================

AMAZON TIME STREAM
Fully managed serverless, time series database
autoscaling
1000s faster and cheaper than RDS

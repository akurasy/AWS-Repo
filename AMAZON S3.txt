S3 OVERVIEW
• Amazon S3 is one of the main building blocks of AWS
• It’s advertised as ”infinitely scaling” storage 
• It’s widely popular and deserves its own section
• Many websites use Amazon S3 as a backbone
• Many AWS services uses Amazon S3 as an integration as well
• We’ll have a step-by-step approach to S3

Amazon S3 Overview - Buckets
• Amazon S3 allows people to store objects (files) in “buckets” (directories)
• Buckets must have a globally unique name
• s3 Buckets looks like a global service, but Buckets are defined at the region level 
• Naming convention
• No uppercase
• No underscore
• 3-63 characters long
• Not an IP
• Must start with lowercase letter or number
  Must not start with a prefix or end with a suffix.

Amazon S3 Overview 
- Objects
• Objects (files) have a Key • The key is the FULL path: • s3://my-bucket/my_file.txt • s3://my-bucket/my_folder1/another_folder/my_file.txt • 
  The key is composed of prefix + object name • s3://my-bucket/my_folder1/another_folder/my_file.txt • There’s no concept of “directories” within buckets
  (although the UI will trick you to think otherwise)
• Just keys with very long names that contain slashes (“/”)
• Object values are the content of the body:
• Max Object Size is 5TB (5000GB)
• If uploading more than 5GB, must use “multi-part upload”
• Metadata (list of text key / value pairs – system or user metadata)
• Tags (Unicode key / value pair – up to 10) – useful for security / lifecycle
• Version ID (if versioning is enabled)

===========================================

AMAZON S3 SECURITY

user-based- IAM policies 
resource-based - bucket policies, ACL (for bucket and object)
encryption - using encryption key. 


BUCKET POLICY FOR PUBLIC ACCESS
IAM POLICY FOR USER IN THE ACCOUNT
IAM ROLE FOR EC2 INSTANCE
BUCKET POLICY FOR CROSS ACCOUNT

S3BUCKET POLICY

• Use S3 bucket for policy to:
	• Grant public access to the bucket 
	• Force objects to be encrypted at upload 
	• Grant access to another account (Cross Account)

Bucket settings for Block Public Access
• Block public access to buckets and objects granted through
• new access control lists (ACLs)
• any access control lists (ACLs)
• new public bucket or access point policies
• Block public and cross-account access to buckets and objects through any public bucket or access point policies
• These settings were created to prevent company data leaks
• If you know your bucket should never be public, leave these on
• Can be set at the account level

===========================================================


S3 WEBSITE

• S3 can host static websites and have them accessible on the www
• The website URL will be:
• <bucket-name>.s3-website-<AWS-region>.amazonaws.com
OR
• <bucket-name>.s3-website.<AWS-region>.amazonaws.com
• If you get a 403 (Forbidden) error, make sure the bucket policy allows public reads!

Amazon S3 -Versioning
• You can version your files in Amazon S3
• It is enabled at the bucket level
• Same key overwrite will increment the “version”: 1, 2, 3….
• It is best practice to version your buckets
• Protect against unintended deletes (ability to restore a version)
• Easy roll back to previous version 

•Notes:
• Any file that is not versioned prior to enabling versioning will have version “null”
• Suspending versioning does not delete the previous versions


=========================================================

AMAZON S3 REPLICATION

CRR = CROSS REGION REPLICATION
SRR = SAME REGION REPLICATION

Must enable bucket version in both destination and source buckets.
buckets can be in different AWS account
copy is asynchronous
must give proper IAM permissions to S3


use cases
CRR - compliance, low latency access, replication accross accounts
SRR - log aggregation, live replication between a test and production accounts. 

PLS NOTE:
- only new objects are replicated
- to replicate an exisiting object, use S3 Batch Replication
- there is no chain replication

S3 STORAGE CLASS OVERVIEW

STORAGE CLASS
amazon S3 standard - general purpose
amazon s3 standard Infrequent-Access (IA)
amazon S3 one-zone IA
amazon S3 glacier instant retrieval
amazon S3 glacier flexible retrieval
amazon S3 glacier deep archive
amazon S3 intelligent tiering.

YOU CAN MOVE OBJECTS BETWEEN CLASS OR USE AMAZON S3 LIFECYCLE CONFIGURATIONS.


S3 standard
99.999% availability
for frequently accessed data
low latency and high throughbut
for big data analytics, gaming platform.


S3 IA
low cost than standard
less frequently accessed but required rapid access when needed.
99.999% available
used for recovery and backups


S3 one-zone IA
high durability 99.9999%
95.99% availability
data is stored in one zone. data is lost when zone is destroyed.
use case: store secondary copies of backup of on-premise data, or data you can recreate.


S3 glacier storage classes
low cost storage option meant for archiving/backup
pricing: price of storage + object retrieval cost

	S3 glacier instant retrieval
	milliseconds retrieval. great for data with once a quater retrieval.
	minimum storage duration of 90days.
	
	S3 glacier flexible retrieval (formerly called amazon S3 glacier)
	expecdited (1-5mins), standard (3-5hours), bulk (5-12hours) ----- free
	minimum storage duration of 90days
	 
	S3 glacier deep archive
	for long term storage
	standard (12hours), bulk (48hours)
	minimum storage duration of 180days.

S3 intelligent tiering
auto-teiring free
moves object between tiers based on usage
no retrival charges

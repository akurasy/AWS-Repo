MONITORING INTRODUCTION
monitoring ensures that your application is running in the right way and you can see the logs and audit.


================================

CLOUDWATCH METRICS

Cloudwatch provides a metrics for your AWS services
METRICS are just the parameters/variables you want to monitor

cloudwatch metric stream helps you to stream cloudwatch metrics to a destintion of your choice with near real-time delivery

destination = kinesis data firehose

EXAM TIP: cloudwatch metrics helps you send RDS autoscaling status to kinesis data firehose. 

=================================

CLOUDWATCH LOGS
perfect place to store your application logs

cloudwatch logs can be sent to 
S3, data stream, firehose, AWS lambda, opensearch
logs are encrypted by default.

sources of logs : SDK, vpc, ECS, beanstalk, lambda, API Gateway, cloudtrail, Route53


Cloudwatch log insights == helps ypu to specify your querry. search and anaylse data in logs

===============================================

CLOUDWATCH AGENT AND CLOUDWATCH LOGS AGENT

By default, no logs from your EC2 instance is sent to your cloudwatch
you need to run a cloudwatch agent on your ec2 to push the log files you want.
ec2 needs to have the necessary IAM role

unified agent is better than logs agent because it can do both metrics and logs

================================================

CLOUDWATCH ALARM

ALARMS are used to trigger notifications for any  metrics

alarm targets -- stop/terminate EC2, trigger autoscaling, send notication to SNS


EC2 INSTANCE RECOVERY used to recover your instance when an instance failed. 

you get the same IP, metadata, placement group, EIP and private IP when the instance is recovered.

Alarms can be created based on cloudwatch logs metrics filter

to test alarm and notifications, set the alarm state using the CLI command 

aws cloudwatch set-alarm-state --alarm-name "myalarm" --state-value ALARM --state-reason "testing purposes" 

====================================================

EVENTBRIDGE OVERVIEW
Used to schedule a cron job
reacts to an event to schedule an action.
the event bus carries the event to event bus, then to partner even bus, then finally to custom event bus.
event buses can be accessed by other AWS account using resource based policy.
you can archive events sent to event bus.
ability to replay archive evnts

USECASE: It is used to aggregate all resources in the AWS organisation into a single AWS account per AWS region.

=============================================

CLOUDWATCH CONTAINER INSIGHT AND OPERATIONAL VISIBILITY

Collects , summarises and aggregate logs and metrics from containers


cloudwatch lambda insights is a monitoring and troubleshooting solution for serverless apps running on AWS Lambda

cloudwatch contributor insights ;
helps you find top talkers and identify who is impacting performance
analyse log data and create time series that display contributor data.

cloudwatch application insight;
provides automated dashboard that shows potential problems with monitored applications , to help isolate ongoing issues

powered by sagemaker



====================================================================


CLOUD TRAIL OVERVIEW

Provides governance, compliance, and audit for your AWS account
cloudtrail is enabled by default

IF A RESOURCE IS DELETED IN AWS AND YOU WONDERING WHO DID IT, INVESTIGATE CLOUDTRAIL FIRST.

Cloudtrain Events
management events = tells you the operations that are performed on your AWS account. can seperate read event from write event.

data events= are not logs. reports S3 events, Lambda events.


CLOUDTRAIL INSIGHTS= This helps to detect unsual activity in your AWS account

cloudtrail event retention = helps you to store events for 90days in cloudtrail


TO KEEP EVENTS BEYOND THIS PERIOD, LOAD THEM TO S3 AND THEN USE ATHENA.

======================================================

AWS CONFIG

helps with audting and recording compliance of your AWS resources
helps record configuration and changes over time.
AWS CONFIG is a per region service.
CONFIG is not a free tier.

Config rules:
can use AWS config rules (up to 75)
can make custom config rules (defined by a lambda function)

============================================================

CLOUDWATCH VS CLOUDTRAIL VS AWS CONFIG

CLOUDWATCH:
	Performance monitoring (metrics, cpu, network) and dashboard
	eventa and alerts
	log aggregration and analysis

CLOUDTRAIL:
	Record API calls made within your account by users
	can defile trail for specific resources
	it is a global service.

AWS CONFIG:
	record configuration changes
	evaluate resources against compliance policy
	get timeline of changes and compliance.

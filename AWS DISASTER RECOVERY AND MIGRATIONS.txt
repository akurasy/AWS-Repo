DISASTER RECOVERY IN AWS

DISASTER is any occurence that has a negative effect on your application
disaster recovery is about preparing for and recovery against disaster


Recovery point objective (RPO) and recovery time objective (RTO)
RPO is how often you run backup. RTO is the downtime the application has after recovery.

pilot-light is a Disaster Recovery strategy with the highest Recovery Time Objective (RTO) and Recovery Point Objective (RPO). it is cheaper to use.
multi-site is a Disaster Recovery strategy with the lowest Recovery Time Objective (RTO) and Recovery Point Objective (RPO), regardless of the cost
warm standby helps you to recover quickly and scale-up automatically incase of disaster.

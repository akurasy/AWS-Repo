 UNDERSTANDING CLASSLESS INTER-DOMAIN ROUTING (CIDR) - IPV4

CIDR = is a method of allocating IP addresses
	used in security group rule and AWS networking in general.

a CIDR consists of two components. 

- Base IP = example; 10.0.0.0
- subnet mask = example; /32  ..... can take two forms : /8 or 255.0.0.0

UNDERSTANDING CIDR - SUBNET MASK

192.168.0.0/32 = allows for 1 IP (2^0) = 192.168.0.0
192.168.0.0/31 = allows for 2 IP (2^1) = 192.168.0.0 - 192.168.0.1
192.168.0.0/30 = allows for 4 IP (2^2) = 192.168.0.0 - 192.168.0.3
192.168.0.0/29 = allows for 8 IP (2^3) = 192.168.0.0 - 192.168.0.7
192.168.0.0/28 = allows for 16 IP (2^4) = 192.168.0.0 - 192.168.0.15
192.168.0.0/27 = allows for 32 IP (2^5) = 192.168.0.0 - 192.168.0.31
192.168.0.0/26 = allows for 64 IP (2^6) = 192.168.0.0 - 192.168.0.63
192.168.0.0/25 = allows for 128 IP (2^7) = 192.168.0.0 - 192.168.0.127
192.168.0.0/24 = allows for 256 IP (2^8) = 192.168.0.0 - 192.168.0.255

192.168.0.0/16 = allows for 65,536 IP (2^16) = 192.168.0.0 - 192.168.255.255

192.168.0.0/0 = allows for all IP addresses = 0.0.0.0 - 255.255.255.255

/32 = no octet can chnage
/24 = last octet can change
/16 = last two octets can change
/8 = last three octets can change
/0 = all octets can change.


little exercise
192.168.0.0/24 = ?
192.168.0.0/16 = ?

https://www.ipaddressguide.com/cidr  = website to help you calculate your ip and cidr block.



PRIVATE VS PUBLIC IP
Private IP can only have the follwoing values 
10.0.0.0 - 10.255.255.255 (10.0.0.0/8)  ====== for big network
172.16.0.0 - 172.31.255.255 (172.16.0.0/8) ===== AWS default VPC in that range
192.168.0.0 - 192.168.255.255 (192.168.0.0/16) ==== home networks

All the rest of the other IP addresses on the internet are public IPs.

========================================================

VPC IN AWS - IPV4
VPC = virtual private cloud
you can have multiple vpc in a single aws region (max of 5 - soft limit)
max CIDR per VPC =5; for each CIDR,
min size is /28 (16 IP addresses)
max size is /16 (65536 IP addresses)

========================================

VPC SUBNET -  IPV4

AWS reserves 5 IP addresses. (first 4 and last 1)
these 5 IP addresses are not available for use and cannot be assigned to an EC2 instance

example: if CIDR block is 10.0.0.0/24, then the reserved IPs are:
10.0.0.0= network address
10.0.0.1= reserved by AWS for the VPC router
10.0.0.2 = reserved for AWS for mapping to amazon-provided DNS
10.0.0.3 = reserved for future use
10.0.0.255 = network broadcast address. 


EXAM TIP: if you need 29 IP addresses for EC2 instances:
you can't choose a subnet of size /27 (32 IP addresses; 32 - 5 (reserved) = 27 < 29)
you need to choose subnet of size /26 (64 IP addresses; 64 - 5 (reserved) = 59 < 29)

===================================================

INTERNET GATEWAY AND ROUTE TABLES.

IGW
allows resource to connect to the internet
it scales horizontally. highly available and redundant
must be created seperately from a VPC
one VPC can only be attched to one IGW and vice-versa.
IGW on their on does not allow intenet access
the route table must be edited.

PLS NOTE: IGW IS ALWAYS CONNECTED TO THE PUBLIC SUBNET VIA THE ROUTE TABLE.


HOW TO USE THE IGW
- create a VPC
- create private and public subnets
- create ec2 and attach it to a public subnet == check if you can use ec2 instant connect to ssh into this instance. it will returned failed, so we use IGW.
- create IGW and attach to a VPC
- create a route table for both your private and public subnets
- for Public RT, edit subnet association and add the public subnet create. Do same for private RT.
- for pub RT, click on action, edit route to add a second route.
- destination = 0.0.0.0/0 ; target = IGW and select the IGW created.
- now connect to the EC2 instant connect again and it will work

the above is to create internet connectivity for the public instance in your VPC using IGW.  

==============================================

BASTION HOSTS

Bastion hosts help users to connect to the private ec2 instance over the internet.

bastion hosts are ec2 instance with the security group called BastionHost-SG. they are kept inside the public subnet.
port 22 must be opened in the bastianhost-SG, and also must be enabled on the private instance we are connecting to. 
the idea is to first connect to the bastian hosts using ssh. 
and the bastion host helps us ssh into the private subnet using the private IP of the instance we are connecting to.


===================================================

NAT INSTANCE (OUTDATED BUT STILL COMES AT THE EXAM)

NAT = Network Address Translation
allows ec2 instance in your private subnet to connect to the internet
must be launched in public subnet
must disable the source destination check
must have an elastic IP
the route table must be configured to route traffic from the private subnets to the NAT instance.

NAT LAB
create an instance called NATinstance
select to browse ami and search for nat, community. select any ami with nat

security group name = nat-instance-sg 
allowed port 22, 80, 443(https), all icmp4.

network edit = select vpc, select public subnet.
launch the instance. 
when launched, select the NAT instance, action, network, Change Source / destination check and tick the box for stop.
go to the route table of the private RT. edit route. source = anywhere, target = instance and select the nat instance.

ssh into the Private instance from the bastion-hosts and ping google.com from the private instance.


=============================================

NAT GATEWAY
AWS managed NAT
created in a specific AZ with elastic IP
Cannot be used by an ec2 instance in the same subnet
requires an internet gateway (private subnet ========> nat gateway ======> IGW)
resilient within a single AZ
must create multiple NAT in multiple AZ for fault-tolerance


===================================================

SECURITY GROUP AND NACL.

NACL are like firewalls that controls traffic to and from the subnets.
one NACL per subnet. new subnets are assigned the default NACL
you define NACL rules:
	rules have a number (1 to 32766). higher precedence with a lower number.
	first rule match will drive the decision.
	example: if you define 100 allow 10.0.0.0/32 and 200 deny 10.0.0.0/32.
	address will be allowed because 100 has a higher precedent over 200.
	the last rule is an asterisk (*) and denies a request incase of no rules match
`	AWS recommends adding rules in increment of 100

newly created NACL will deny everything by default
NACL are great way of blocking a specific IP address at the subnet level.

DEFAULT NACL allows everything out and everything in. accepts everything inbound/outbound within the subnet it is associated with.

EPHEMERAL PORTS are refers to as the client ports. these ports are ephemeral because they remain alive until the connection is timed out.

==============================================================

VPC PEERING

private connect two VPC's using AWS' network
make them behave as if they were bin the same network
must not have overlapping CIDR
VPC peering are not transitive. must be enabled on each vpc
you must update rout tables in each vpc subnets to ensure EC2 instances can communicate with each other.

=======================================================

VPC ENDPOINT

Every AWS service is publicly exposed
VPC ENDPOINT helps you connect to your AWS service directly using the private network without going through the public internet.
they are redundant and scale horizontally
they remove the need of IGW, NATGW, to access AWS services
In case of issues:
1. check DNS setting resolution in yur vpc
2. check route tables.

TYPES OF ENDPOINT

Interface endpoints
uses the ENI as an entry point (must attach security group)

Gateway endpoints
provisions a gateway that must be used as target in the route table. (does not need SG)
supports both S3 and DynamoDB.
free.
S3 and DynamoDB are end points for your VPC, These two services have a VPC Gateway Endpoint (remember it),
all the other ones have an Interface endpoint (powered by Private Link - means a private IP).

GATEWAY OR INTERFACE EDNPOINT FOR S3 ? = GATEWAY is more likely to be preffered all the time at the exam. 
INTERFACE ENDPOINT IS PREFFERRED when access is required from on-premise (site-to-site VPN or direct connect), a diffrent vpc or a different region.

==========================================================

VPC FLOW LOGS
Capture information about IP going into your interfaces
helps to monitor and troubleshoot connectivity issues
flow log data can go to S3, cloudwatch logs, and kinesis data firehose.

when you create a log on ATHENA, it helps you analyse the details of your log in tabular format.

=============================================================


SITE TO SITE VPN: VIRTUAL PRIVATE GATEWAY, AND CUSTOMER GATEWAY.

SITE TO SITE VPN:
Used to connect aws to a corporate data center.
site-to-sit VPN needs two things 
1. virtual private gateway = this uses aws VPN connection
2. customer gateway =  on-premise. it uses the public IP route table of your customer gateway
if it's behind a NAT device thats enabled on NAT-traversa (NAT-T) use the public IP of the NAT device.

EXAM NOTICE : 
- enable the route propagation for the virtual private gateway in the route table that is associated to your subnet
- if you need to ping an EC2 instance from your on-premise, then you must enable the all ICMP protocol on the inbound of your security.

AWSVPN CLOUDHUB = is to provide secure communication between AWS and multiple customer gateway (multiple sites). if you have multiple VPN connections.


SUMMARY
before you create a site to site VPN, you must first create a customer gateway ( this is an onpremise server). then create a virtual private gateway and use 
site to site VPN to connect the two together.

===============================================================

DIRECT CONNECT (DX)
provides a dedicated private connection from your remote NETWORK to your VPC.
supports both IPV4 and IPV6
Hybrid environment (on-premise + cloud)
if you want to setup a direct connect in multiple vpc in difrrent region in the same account, you must use direct connect gateway.

connetion types = dedicated connection and hosted connection

FOR MAXIMUM RESILIENCE, SET UP FOUR CONNECTIONS IN TWO LOCATIONS. i.e two connections per location.


===========================================================

TRANSIT GATEWAY (in my own language, remember jenkins)

used to connect thousands of VPC with your on-premise network. this resolves the issue of network topologies
you can also connect multiple vpc, direct connect gateway, and coustomer gateway (using VPN connection) on transit gateway
regional resource but can work cross-region
route table limits which vpc can talk to each other.
ITS THE ONLY GATEWAY THAT SUPPORTS IP MULTI-CAST. if you see IP multi-cast in your exam, just know it's transit gateway
transit gateway is also used to increase the bandith of your VPN connection using ECMP. (equal cost multi path routing)

============================================================

VPC TRAFFIC MIRRORING
allows you to capture and inspect network traffic in your vpc
to do so, your route traffic to a security device you are managing.
pls do not mistake this for VPC flow logs, while vpc flow logs captures traffic, vpc traffic mirrioring copy the traffic to another security device

====================================================


AWS VPN CloudHub allows you to securely communicate with multiple sites using AWS VPN. 
It operates on a simple hub-and-spoke model that you can use with or without a VPC.


====================================================

IPV6 FOR VPC

IPV4 is designed to provide 4.3billion IP addresses abd it will be exhausted soon.
IPV6 is the successor of ipv4
Its designed to provide 3 x 10^38 unique IP addresses.
every IPV6 address is public and internet routable. (no private range)

IF YOU HAVE IPV4 AND IPV6 IN YOUR VPC AND YOU CANNOT CREATE A NEW IPV4 ON YOUR EC2 , IT MIGHT BE BECAUSE YOU HAVE EXHAUSTED THE IP RANGE IN YOUR CIDR BLOCK. THE 
SOLUTION IS TO CHANGE YOUR CIDR VALUE TO ACCOMODATE MORE IPs

==================================

EGRESS ONLY INTERNET GATEWAY
similar to NAT GW, but are used only for IPV6
allows instance in your vpc outbound connection


===============================================

VPC SUMMARY

CIDR = IP range
VPC = virtual private cloud
subnets = tied to an AZ. we define a CIDR
internet gateway = at the VPC level, provide IPV4 and IPV6 internet access.
route tables= must be edited to add routes from subnets, IGW, VPC peering connections, VPC endpoints.........
Bastion Host = public EC2 instance to SSH into the instance of our private subnets
NAT instances= gives internet access to EC2 instance in your rpivate subnets. you must select a NAT AMI to use this. old, must be setup in a public network
NAT Gateway= managed by AWS to provide scalable internet access to your private EC2 instances. allows only IPV4
NACL= stateless. defines inbound abd outbound at the subnet level. PORTS ARE EPHEMERAL
security group= stateful. and operates at the EC2 instance level.
VPC peering= to connect two more VPCs. no overlapping CIDR, Trasnitive.
VPC ENPOINT= provides private access to AWS resources. (S3, DynamoDB. SSM, cloud formation .......
VPC flow logs = can be setup at the VPC/ENI/SUBNET level for accept and reject traffic. helps to identity attck. analyze using athena or cloudwatch log insight.
site to site VPN = to connect your VPC to onpremise data center.
AWSVPN Cloudhub = to connect multiple vpc to on-premise data center.
VPC direct connect= privately connect your vpc to your onpremise data center. it does not go over the public internet.
direct connect gateway = is used to setup many vpc in different aws region.
AWS privatelink/ VPC endpoint services = used to privately connect your own vpc to customer's vpc created. mostly used with NLB and ENI. No NAT, no IGW, RT .....
transit gateway = connection for your VPC, DX, and VPN.
traffic mirroring = copy traffic from ENI for further analysis
Egress only IGW = your IPV6 outbound rule. like NAT gateway



====================================

AWS NETWORK FIREWALL

protects our entire VPC from layer3 to layer 7 protection.

it uses the gateway load balancer.

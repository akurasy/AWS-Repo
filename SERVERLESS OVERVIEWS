LAMBDA OVERVIEW

LAMBDA initally called function as a service (FaaS)is a virtual functions. no server to manage
run on demand
limited by time
scaling is automated.
up to 10GB per function
increasing the RAM of function will increase throughput

languages: Node.js, pyhton, java, C#, Golang, ruby, C#/powershell, RUST.

ECS/FARGATE is preferred for running docker images on Lambda

first 1million requests are free.
400GB/s compute time per month for free 



=============================================

LAMBDA LIMITS - per region.

execution:
limit= 128MB - 10GB
max execution time 900secs
environmental variables
disk capacity in the container 512mb to 10gb

deployment:
deployment size 50mb
size of uncompressed deployment 250mb
can us /tmp directory to load other files from startup
size of environment variables: 4kb

PLS NOTE : LAMBDA IS NOT GOOD FOR A HEAVY WORKLOAD.

=================================================================

LAMBDA@EDGE AND CLOUDFRONT FUNCTIONS

CUSTOMIZATION AT EDGE LOCATION
this means you want to run your lambda function at an edge location close to the user. this will minimize latency and increase throughput.
this is done by attaching a code to cloudfront distribution

cloudfront provide two types of functions: cloudfront functions and lambda@edge

Amazon CloudFront is a fast content delivery network (CDN) service that securely delivers data, videos, applications, 
and APIs to customers globally with low latency, high transfer speeds. This is a perfect use case for Amazon CloudFront.

usecase:
website security and privacy
dynamic web app at the edge
search engine optimization (SEO)
intelligently route accross origin and data cneters
Bot mitigation at the edge
real-time image transformation
A/B testing
user authentication and authorisation 
user prioritization
user tracking and analytics

Cloudfront functions
client interract with cloudfront, cloudfront interacts with the origin to produce a client/viewer request.

lambda@edge
used to scale cloudfront request and responses

LAMBDA DOEST NOT HAVE AN OUT NOF THE BOX CACHING FEATURE.

==========================================================

LAMBDA IN VPC

LAMBDA are launched in AWS managed VPC
it doesnt have the capacity to have access to external VPC outside AWS

RDS proxy is used to solve the architecture problem of your database. 

lamda connects to your rds proxy and rds proxy connects to your rds database.

===================================================

RDS - INVOKING LAMBDA AND EVENT NOTIFICATIONS
Invoke lmabda from rds and aurora

==================================================

AMAZON DYNAMODB
fully managed, highly available with replication accross multiple AZs.
noSQL , noRDS
fast and consistent in perfprmance (SINGLE-DIGIT MILLISECONDS PERFORMANCE).
integrated with IAM for security
always available

read/write capacity mode
provisioned mode (default)
on-demand mode

ADVANCED DYNAMODB

DYNAMODB ACCELERATOR (DAX)
fully managed inmemory cache for dynamodb
help solve congestion by caching
doesnt require application for logic modification
5mins TTL for cache
integrated with TTL
integration with S3
used for disaster recovery: point in time recovery (PITR)

DynamoDB Streams enable DynamoDB to get a changelog and use that changelog to replicate data across replica tables in other AWS Regions.

=========================================================

API GATEWAY OVERVIEW.

This is a serverless gateway from AWS which allows us to create a rest API that can be made public and accessible for clients.
support for websocket protocol

API GATEWAY ENDPOINTS
edge optimised (default)
regional
private = used within your vpc

API GATEWAY SECURITY

user authenticatioin through IAM roles (internal app) 
cognito (identity for external users), 
customised authorizer (lambda invoked function)

custom domain name HTTPS security through integration with AWS certificate manager (ACM)

==========================================

AWS STEP FUNCTION

this is a process of building a serverless visual workflow to orchestrate your lambda function and supports human approval.

===================================

AMAZON COGNITO
it enables users to interact with web and mobile app
it provides the sign in functionality for app users.
it enables you to create a user base for your mobile and web application
IT IS SPECIFIC FOR USERS SITTING OUTSIDE OF AWS

COGNITO VS IAM : hundreds of users, mobile users, authenticate with SAML


FEAUTRES OF COGNITO
serverless for mobile and web app
username feature
password feature
password reset 
email and phone number verification
MFA
federal identity; intergation with email, facebook google and SAML e.t.c


COGNITO IDENTITY POOL ALLOWS USERS TO HAVE ACCESS TO AWS SERVICES DIRECTLY THROUGH THE API GATEWAY

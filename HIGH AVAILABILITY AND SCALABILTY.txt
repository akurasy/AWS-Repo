SCALABILITY means your application/system can handle greater work loads by adapting

TYPES OF SCALABILTIY
vertical scalability = increasing the size of your instance.
horizontal scalability = elasticity

scalability is linked but different from high availability

	VERTICAL SCALABILITY
-	vertical scabilty means increasing the size of your instance.
-	example:. you have a t2.micro instance and you want to scale it up to t3.large
	commonly used for data base.

-	RDS and Elasticcache can be scaled vertically by upgrading the underlying instance type.
-	there is a scaling limit (hardware limit)


	HORIZONTAL SCALABILITY
-	means increasing the number of instance/system for your application
-	works for distributed system e.g web applications and modern applications
-	it is easy to scale horizontally. Thanks to amazon EC2 instance.

VERTICAL = SIZE OF INSTANCE (scale up or down)     ===========     HORIZONTAL = NUMBERS (QUANTITY) OF INSTANCE (scale in or out)


HIG AVAILABLITY means running your application in at least two data centers (==AZ)
The role of high availability is to survive data center loss.


=================================================================


ELASTIC LOAD BALANCER

They are servers that forwward traffic to multiple servers (e.g EC2 instance) downstream.

USECASE
Spread accross multiple downstream instances, application is exposed to a single point, do regular health checks for your instances,
enforce stickiness with cookies, high availability accross zones, seperate public traffic from private traffic.

HEALTH CHECK ensures that the instance is healthy to receive and send request.


TYPES OF LB
classic LB = support HTTP,HTTPS,TCP AND SSL (SECURED TP)  CLB-2009
application LB = supports HTTP,HTTPS,WebSocket  ALB-2016 
networl LB = supports TCP, TLS, UDP   NWLB-2017
gateway LB = operates at layer 3 (network layer) - IP protocol  GWLB-2020

LB SECURITY GROUP = 80 AND 443.


======================================================================

APPLICATIOB LB
Load balancing to multiple HTTP apps accross machines (target group)
redirect traffic from http to https
routing based on path in url e.g example.com/posts and example.com/users
route based on hostname in the url e.g one.example.com 
route based on querry strings and headers e.g example.com/users?id=123&order=false
good for mirco services and container based application. e.g docker and Amazon ECS

When using an Application Load Balancer to distribute traffic to your EC2 instances, the IP address you'll receive requests from will be the 
ALB's private IP addresses. To get the client's IP address, ALB adds an additional header called "X-Forwarded-For" contains the client's IP address.

=======================================================

NETWORK LB
layer4 LB allows you to forward  UDP and TCP traffic to your instance.
handles millions of request per sec
least latency
supports EIP
supports extreme performance.
target group = ec2 instances or IP address (private IP) or application LB
health check supports http,https and tcp protocol

the NLB supports HTTP health checks as well as TCP and HTTPS

===========================================================

GATEWAY LB
GWLB used to deploy, scale and manage a fleet of 3rd party network virtual appliances in AWS
example: firewall, intrusion detection, and prevention system. deep packet inspection systems and payload manipulation.
operates at layer3 (network layer) IP packets.
use the GENEVE PROTOCOL ON PORT 6081.

============================================

ELASTIC LOAD BALANCER SSL AND TLS CERTIFICATE

SSL certificate allows traffic between users and load balancers to be encrypted in transit. (in-flight encryption)
SSL = secure socket layer.

TLS is transport layer security which is a newer version.

SSL certificates have expiry date that you set and must be renewed.

SSL -SNI (SERVER NAME INDICATION)
SNI solves the problem of loading multiple SSL certificate into one web server
it is a newer protocol and allows the client to indicate their hostname of the target server in the initial SSL handshake.

NOTE: only works for ALB AND NLB

===============================================

ELB connection draining

for CLB it is called connection draining
for ALB or NLB it is called deregistration delay

when there is an unhealthy check. it stops sending request to the ec2. de-registering it.

======================================================

AUTOSCALING GROUP
ASG creates and get rid of server very quickly. used for scale out and scale in.
ASG ensures we have minimum and maximum numbers of instances running.
ASG creates a new instance if an instance is terminated.
ASG are free
it is possible to scale ASG based on cloudwatch alarms.
an alarm monitors a metric.
=============================================

ASG SCALING POLICY
TARGET TRACKING SCALING; most simple and easy to use , you can set your maximum CPU capacity
SIMPLE / STEP SCALING: when a cloud watch alarm is triggered, then add 2 units 
SCHEDULED ACTION: anticipate a scaling based on known usage pattern. example; increase from 5 to 10 at every 5pm on Fridays.



PREDICTIVE SCALING = forecast based on historical scaling in the past
ASG COOLING DOWN PERIOD
it allows instances to cool down after scaling. it will not scale during this period to allow for metrics stabilization.

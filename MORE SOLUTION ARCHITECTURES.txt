EVENT PROCESSING IN AWS

In event processing in AWS you can use the following:
SQS and Lambda
SQS FIFO and lambda = SQS FIFO helps messages to be processed in order.
SNS + LAMBDA= SNS sends the message asynchronously to a Lambda function. the lambda processes, if it fails, it retries 3 times
message is discard after the 3rd time or you can further attach an SQS to the Lambda after receiving messages from SNS topic.

FANOUT PATTERN: TO DELIVER DATA TO MULTIPLE SQS

SDK (put) ====> SNS (subscribe)=====> MULTIPLE SQS
the multiple SQS are going to be subscribers of our SNS topic.


S3 EVENTS NOTIFICATION
used to generate thumbnails of images uploaded to S3.
EVENTS HAPPENED IN AMAZON S3 AND CAN BE SENT TO SNS, SQS AND LAMBDA

S3 EVENTS NOTIFICATIONS WITH AMAZON EVENTBRIDGE
events are first sent to amazon S3 bucket for processing, all events are sent to eventbridge, and be sent to 18 AWS services as destination.


API GATEWAY  - AWS SERVICE INTEGRATION

Client (requests)======  API Gateway (send)======  kinesis Data Streams (records)======  Kinesis Data Firehose (store)======= Amazon S3

==========================================================

CACHING STRATEGY IN AWS

client === Cloudfront (caching at the edge) ==== API Gateway =====  app logic/EC2 (no caching)========== redis mamcache DAX or can be sent to amazon rds (no caching here)
client === cloudfront at edge (caching at edge) ======= s3 (no caching on S3)

=======================================================

BLOCKING AN IP ADDRESS IN AWS

The first point of security is the NACL.
at the NACL level, you can create a deny rule to block a specific IP address.
pls note there is no deny rule at the SG level. only allow rule.

blocking an IP with NLB
the NLB does not have a SG. so all traffic goes through it to the application. the best bet is to configure the security at the NACL level


BLOCKING IP ADDRESS - WAF + ALB

WAF = web application firewall. the way to filter incoming IP is to add WAF on the ALB and WAF filters the incoming IP addresses.

BLOCKING IP ADDRESS - WAF + ALB + CLOUDFRONT
if the cloudfront is put infront of the ALB, install WAF on the cloudfront to filter all IP addresses.

PLS NOTE IF CLOUDFRONT IS INVOLVED IN YOUR ARCHITECTURE, NACL WILL NOT BE HELPFUL IN BLOCKING IP, BECAUSE THE CLIENT TALKS DIRECTLY WITH THE CLOUD FRONT 
WHICH IS IN FRONT OF THE ALB KEPT INSIDE THE VPC SUBNET AND NACL IS ONLY ACTIVE AT THE SUBNET LEVEL.

HIGH PERFORMANCE COMPUTING (HPC) IN AWS

DATA TRASNFER AND MANAGEMENT

AWS DIRECT CONNECT: transfer data over a private network
SNOWBALL OR SNOWMOBILE : to move petabytes of data to cloud
AWS DATASYNC= this is an agent installed on on-premise server and it helps us to move data between onpremise and S3, EFS, FSx for windows.

COMPUTE AND NETWORKING
EC2 instances. CPU AND GPU optimised
EC2 placement groups = cluster for good network performance. (when we have multiple EC2 that talks to each other)


EC2 ENHANCED NETWORKING: high throughput and low latency
popularly used is the ELASTIC NETWORK ADAPTER (ENA) up to 100Gbps

you can also use the ELASTIC FABRIC ADAPTER (EFA). EFA is an improved ENA. Only works for linux.
EFA leverages the message passing interface (MPI). MPI bypasses the underlying linux OS to provide low-latency, reliable transport.


STORAGE
Instance attached storage (EBS). 
Network storage = S3, EFS, FSx for lustre.

AUTOMATION AND ORCHESTRATION
AWS Batch= use to run a single job that spans multiple EC2 instances.

AWSParallel Cluster. open-source cluster management tool to deploy HPC on AWS.
automate creation of VPC, subnets, cluster types and instance types.
ability to enable EFA on the cluster


==============================================================

EC2 INSTANCE HIGH AVAILABILITY

creating a standby instance to be promoted to the primary instance from a lambda call attached to the cloudwatch when an invent is trigerred.
autoscaling group.

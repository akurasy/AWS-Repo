CLOUDFRONT OVERVIEW

CLOUDFRONT ALLOWS USERS TO PUBCLICLY ACCESS THE CONTENT OF OUR S3 BUCKET WITHOUT MAKING THE OBJECTS PUBLIC

content delivey network (CDN)
improve read performance by cahing content
it improves user experience
216 point of present globally (edge location)
DDoS protection. 

CLOUDFRONT ORIGINS
S3 : can be used an ingress (uploading files to S3)
     for distributing files and caching them at edge locations
     enhanced security with cloudfront origin access control (OAC)

custom origin - HTTP
- ALB
- EC2 instance
- S3 website (must first enabled the bucket as a static website)
- any HTTP backend you want

CLOUD FRONT VS S3 CROSS REGION REPLICATION
CLOUDFRONT: 
Global edge network
good for static content that must be available all over the owrld
contents are cached

S3 CRR
good for dynamic content that keeps changing. in few regions
no caching
read only
files are uploaded in near real time.
====================================================================

CLOUD FRONT - ALB OR EC2 AS ORIGIN
our EC2 instance must be public and enabled all SG to allow traffic, because there is no private VPC connection on cloud front.

ALB must be made public as well and the backend ec2 instance can be private.


==================================================

CLOUDFRONT GEO-RESTRICTION

you can restrict who can access your distribution
allowlist: allow users in certain country to access your dstribution
blocklist: block users in certain country not to have accesss to your distributions.

the country is determined using the Geo-IP data base of the user to match the blocked country.

===============================================

CLOUDFRONT PRICING

CLOUDFRONT edge location are all aroubd the world, but the cost data for each edge location varies.
you can reduce the number of edge locations for cost reduction

===============================================

CLOUDFRONT CACHE INVALIDATION
If you update your app at the backend, cloudfront doesnt know about it.
it only refreshes the updated app after the TTL has expired
but you want to quickly serve the updated app as quickly as possible, you can do this by;
bypassing the TTL and perform a cloudfront invalidation
 you can invalidate all files or a special path. 


=================================================


AWS GLOBAL ACCELERATOR

AWS GA helps to minimise latency.
GA uses Anycast-IP, where all servers have the same IP address.
uses 2 static IP (Antcast-IP) to route traffic to the nearest edge location of the use all around the world.
good for disaster revocery
DDoS protection


GLOBAL ACCELERATOR VS CLOUD DISTRIBUTION

They both AWS global network and edge location all around the world
 
cloudfront:
improves perfomance for cache and dynamic contents
content is served at the edge.

GA:
Improves performance over a wide range of app using TCP and UDP
no caching available
good for non HTTP usage such as gaming, IoT OR voice over IP
good for great failover

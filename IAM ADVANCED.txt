AWS ORGANIZATION OVERVIEW

Global service that allows you to manage multiple AWS accounts.
the main account is the management account
other accounts are member accounts
consolidated billing accross all account, yet single payment method
price benfit for aggregate usage. discount on some resources
share rserved instance

security = service control policy (SCP)
scp example = blocklist and allowlist

==============================================

IAM ADVANCED POLICIES
aws:PrincipalorgID can be used to restrict account of users who are members of aws organisation

IAM ROLES VS RESOURCE BASED POLICIES

cross account: you can attach a resource based policy for an api in a cross account OR using a role as a proxy.

When you assume a role, you give up your original permission and take up the permission assign to that role.

resource based policy, principal doesnt give up origninal his original permissions

aws:RequestedRegion policy is an  IAM condition key you can use only to allow API calls to a specified AWS region

When configuring permissions for EventBridge to configure a Lambda function as a target you 
should use RESOURCE-BASED POLICY but when you want to configure a Kinesis Data Streams as a target you should use IDENTITY-BASED POLICY

===========================================

IAM PERMISSION BOUNDARIES
IAM permission boundaries are supported for users and roles (not for groups)
it is used to set the maximum level of permission for an IAM entity.

when you have an exclusive deny, you cannot perform any other task on that statement.


===============================================

AWS IAM IDENTITY CENTER (SUCCESSOR TO AWS SINGLE SIGN-ON)

The idea of this is to use one single login for all your aws accounts in aws organisation

identity providers
built-in identity store in AWS IAM identity center
3rd party: active directory (AD), OneLogin, Okta.... 


=========================================

ACTIVE DIRECTORY SERVICES

microsoft AD found on any windows server with ADDS
database of objects: users, account, computer, printers, SG
centralsied security management, create account, assign permissions
objects are organised in trees, a group of trees is called forest.

AWS managed microsoft AD
create your own ID in AWS, manage users locally, supports MFA.
establish a trust connection between your on premise AD

AD CONNECTOR
Directory gateway to redirect to on premise AD. supports MFA.
users are managed on the on premise AD

SIMPLE AD 
AD compactible managed directory on AWS, 
cannot be joined with onpremise AD.


=============================

AWS CONTROL TOWER
easy way to setup and govern a secure and compliant multi-account AWS environment based on best practices.
AWS control tower uses AWS organisation to create accounts.

benefits:
automate account with a few clicks
automate ongoing policy mgt

aws control tower guardtrail provides ongoing governance for your control tower environment.


====================================================

You can use organizational units (OUs) to group accounts together to administer as a single unit. This greatly simplifies the management of your accounts.
For example, you can attach a policy-based control to an OU, and all accounts within the OU automatically inherit the policy.

You can use OUs to organize your non-production environments in a couple ways.

Sometimes your process for developing and testing changes involves workload environments that have fundamentally different access
policies or ways in which you manage and apply foundational resources. In these cases, it makes sense to create distinct OUs to support these diverse requirements.

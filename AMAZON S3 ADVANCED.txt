S3 analytics
help you decide when to transition object to the right storage class.

your application can achieve at least 3500 put/copy/delete/post or 5500 get/head requests per second per prefix in a bucket.

MULTI-PART UPLOAD
recommended for files above 100mb and must be used for file that are over 5GB.
can help parallelize upload (speed up upload process)


S3 TRANSFER ACCELERATION.
Increase transfer speed by transferring the file to AWS edge location which will forward the file to S3 bucket in the target region.

compactible with multipart upload


===========================================================

S3 SELECT AND GLACIER SELECT
retrieve less data using SQL by performing server-side filtering.
less network transfer, less CPU cost client-side

============================================ 

S3 BATCH OPERATIIONS
Allows you to perform bulk operation on S3 objects with a single request. example;
modify object metadata, encrypt all unencrypted s3 object, invoke Lambda function to perform custom action on each object.

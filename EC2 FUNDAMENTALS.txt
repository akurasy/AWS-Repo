	EC2 = virtual server = IaaS


AWS BUDGET SETUP
You need to be in root account to set up billing alert and give access to IAM user.

goto account, scroll down to IAM user and role access to Billing information, ACTIVATE the permission for IAM user to access billings


create budget helps you create a budget for your aws account in the billing console.



EC2 BASICS
operating system
cpu
memeory
bootstrap = user data

E2 USER DATA========= USED TO TO AUTOMATE BOOTSTRAP AT EC2 LAUNCH.


Security Groups & Classic Ports Overview
They are refers to as aws firewall 
grant access to ports
authorised IP ranges- IPv4 and IPv6
control both inbound and outbound network

SECURITY GROUPS GOOD TO KNOW
- security group lives outside yoyr ec2
- can be attached to multiple instances
- maintain one security group for ssh
- locked down to a region/vpc combination
- if your application is not accessible then it is security group issue.
- by default all inbound is blocked and all outbound authorised.

CLASSIC PORTS TO KNOW
22 - SSH
21 - FTP
22- SFTP
80 - HTTP
443- HTTPS
3389 - RDP


SSH
RULE OF THUMB=== never connect to your aws with aws configure using your api keys (access key and secret key)
instead use the IAM role for the instance.


EC2 INSTANCE PURCHASING OPTIONS

ON-DEMAND== Short workload, predictable pricing, pay by seconds
reserved == long workload, covertible-reserved instance== long workload and flexible.
ec2 savings plan

RESERVED Instance
up to 72% discount compared to on-demand
reserve specific attributes (instance type, region, OS)
You reserve period == 1YEAR (+dsicount), 3years (+++ discount)
payment options = no-upfront (+), partial (++), all upfront (+++)
reserve instance scope ==== regional or zonal (reserved capacity in AZ)
recommeded for steady-state usage application (think database)
you can buy and sell in marketplace if you dont need them anymore

covertible-reserved instance ============ allows you to change your OS, scope, ec2 instance type and family. 66% discount.


EC2 Savings  Plan
72% discount
locked to a specific instance family and types. not flexible



EC2 SPOT INSTANCE
90% discount
most cost efficient instance in aws
used for workload that are resilient to failure.
not good for database
you can only cancel a spot instance that are active. opened or disabled.
In EC2 spot, you can specify your max billing, once the threshold is reached, the instance is stopped or interrupted.
it is your duty to terminate the instance. before you terminate, delete the spot request; otherwise, the request will assume you need a new 
instance after termination and will relaunch another one. 



EC2 DEDICATED HOSTS======= Physical server dedicated to your host. most expensive

EC2 DEDICATED INSTANCE ===== You have server inside your physical hardware
not good for placement jobs.



EC2 CAPACITY RESERVATION ===
Reserve on-demand instances capacity in a specific AZ for a duration of time.
you get charged for on-demand rate whether or not you use your instance




SPOT FLEET
Set of spot instances + (optional) on-demand instances
spot fleet stops launching instance when max cost capacity is reached.
can have multiple fleet so the pool can choose.

STRATEGIES to allocate spot instances
- low price : it will choose the pool with the low price (cost optimization. long workloads)
- diversified: distributed accross all pools (great availability, long workloads)
- capacity optimized
- prize capacity optimized (recommended): pool with highest capacity available. then select pool with lower price.(best choice for workloads)
